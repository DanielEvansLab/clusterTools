Some of these questions are things that are missing, some are from basic curiosity.

1. Why did you install pigz? It is a parallel gzip. Not needed for warewulf, but do you use it later?
 
2. Any issues with perl-DBD-MySQL talking with mariadb? Why use mariaDB instead of MySQL?

3. This deployment assumes that the server is configured as per document Hydra-FileServer-CentOS7. **We don't have that doc from Vince, can you send that?**

4. You install libselinux-devel, but aren't we diabling SELinux? Used later?

5. Crypt::HSXKPasswd? Looks like it's a specific function in the Crypt Perl module. Where is this used, and by what?
